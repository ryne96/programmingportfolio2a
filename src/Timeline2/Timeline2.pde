", true);

  histEvent(300, 200, "1946", "In 1945, John von Neumann wrote a draft of a report on the EDVAC in Princeton New Jersey.\n Mathematician John von Neumann talks about the development of stored program computers like electronic storage of computer programming information and data.\n This makes the need for storage like plugboards, punched cards, and paper unneeded. After the war, the focused on developing the Princetonâ€™s Institute for Advanced Studies Computer", true);

The University of Manchester researched the Small Scale Experimental  Machines or called the Baby.\n The Baby was built to test new memory technology developed by Frederic Williams and Tom Kilburn.\n The Williams Tube was the first high speed electronic random access memory for computers.", false);

The ERA 1101 was one of the first computers to be produced commercially in Minnesota.\n The ERA 1101 was built by Remington-Rand and was intended for high speed processing and stored 1 million bits on its magnetic drum,\n one of the earliest magnetic storages.

At MIT, researchers were experimenting with keyboard inputs to a computer.\n Usually computer users at that time inserted their program into computers using punched cards or paper tapes.\n Doug Ross said that a Flexowriter was an electrically controlled typewriter that was connected to MIT computer which would act as a keyboard.", true);
  histEvent(800, 300, "1958", "In 1958, RCA introduced its Model 501 transistorized computer made by John Vassos in New Jersey, America.\n The 501 was built on a building block concept which could control up to 63 tape drives because of the concept's flexibility.\n Although it had slow processing speeds, it's easy access to great storage benefited more towards customers and businesses.", false);
